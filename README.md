Welcome to the Web Application Development course repository! This repository contains all the course materials, including exercises and laboratories, for the second semester of the first year in the Master of Science in Cybersecurity program. The course is delivered in English and focuses on creating distributed web applications with an emphasis on front-end development using JavaScript and modern client-side frameworks.

## Course Description

This course presents the main techniques for creating distributed web applications, with a particular focus on front-end programming. Students will explore the programming paradigms essential for modern web development by:
- Analyzing native JavaScript code.
- Studying approaches provided by a dominant client-side framework.

Additionally, the course addresses critical security aspects of browser-based web applications, empowering students to make informed design choices while maintaining robust security practices.

## Topics Covered

- **Web Fundamentals:** Recall of web architectures, HTML5, and CSS.
- **Design & Layouts:** Complex layouts, CSS frameworks, and notions of web design.
- **JavaScript Essentials:** Understanding JavaScript as a language, including variables, objects, and execution environments (both in the browser and NodeJS).
- **DOM & Event Handling:** Managing forms, tables, the DOM, events, callbacks, and closures.
- **Server-Side Programming:** Introduction to web servers using ExpressJS, package managers, and related security issues.
- **Data & Asynchronous Operations:** Working with JSON, HTTP APIs, and asynchronous programming techniques (async/await, Promise, Fetch).
- **Single Page Applications:** Introduction to reactive programming and the basics of ReactJS.
- **React Development:** Building React applications with components and JSX.
- **Security Mechanisms:** Exploring identification, authentication, API authorization, tokens, signatures, and server-side validation.
- **Application Architecture:** Studying complex application architectures, event routing, and state management.
- **Web Security:** Addressing web-related security issues and best practices.
- **Deployment:** Strategies for deploying and publishing web applications.
- **Practical Application:** Reviewing real-world application examples.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main folders:

- **exercises/**  
  This folder contains a series of weekly exercises organized by topic and programming language. Each week is divided into:
  - **JavaScript**
  - **NodeJS**
  - **ReactJS**

- **laboratories/**  
  This folder holds laboratory projects that mirror the topics and programming languages used in the exercises. Each lab is structured to provide hands-on experience with:
  - **JavaScript**
  - **NodeJS**
  - **ReactJS**

A sample directory tree looks like this:
